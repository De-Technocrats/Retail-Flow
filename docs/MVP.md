**Risk**: Real-time updates causing performance issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient WebSocket handling
- **Contingency**: Disable real-time features under high load

### Timeline Risks

**Risk**: Feature scope creep
- **Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition and change control
- **Contingency**: Move non-essential features to post-MVP

**Risk**: Contributor availability
- **Mitigation**: Over-communicate progress and blockers
- **Contingency**: Prioritize core features over nice-to-haves

**Risk**: Third-party dependency issues
- **Mitigation**: Pin dependency versions, maintain alternatives
- **Contingency**: Vendor lock-in avoidance strategy
